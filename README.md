# Mini-Project-college
Our team is proposing a system which in an amalgamation of an Application and IoT devices.  The objective of our project is to build an application which can be used by the parents or care-takers to continuously monitor the body temperature and safety of the children.   Our project mainly works through an application which can be installed in any Android, iOS and Windows enabled smart-phones. The application will be designed through Flutter, which is an Open-source UI software development kit created by Google. Flutter not only makes the application work on cross-platforms but it also gives a pluggable look and feel to the application.    Internet of things (IoT) also plays a very major role in this project. A Temperature sensor will enable us to take in the temperature of the body of a child and an Accelerometer sensor ensures the safety of a child which can detect if the child tumbles. These two sensors will be connected to an Arduino board.   In order to retrieve the values of the sensors continuously to the application we take the help of Firebase which acts like a database with the capacity of constant self updations
